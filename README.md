INSTRUCTUONS OF USE: The see the animation in action, all you need to do is click the above link and if you looked away before seeing the ‚ú®magic‚ú® happen, just refresh the page.

## Introduction & Features

The purpose of this project is to keep finding ways in which I can make web pages feel a bit more interactive for the user and what better way to do that than with a fresh ground cup of coffee(I think that coffee addiction is becoming a bit more prevelantü§£).

## Features

Using the GSAP library, specifically the TweenMax & TimelineMax features I have created an interactive feeling to the page as the user first opens the page which hopefully helps the user feel more welcome and get a true feeling of the purpose of the webpage.
